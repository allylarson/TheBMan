I'm having this same issue in all browsers in Mobile View only: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16149701/bootstrap-dropdowns-menus-appearing-behind-other-elements-ie7

But I tried the resolutions there and it's not working when I upload the files. Weird thing is when I tried it in Chrome's Inspect field, it does work (the z-index and position:relative;)

Additionally, it's not a problem on the Home Page, only on the subpages. Any help is appreciated.

I'm guessing it's inheriting from somewhere else, but no idea where.
